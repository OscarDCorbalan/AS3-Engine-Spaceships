# Biwair Engine
**This repo only includes liberated code, but not any kind of assets of which I still keep the copyright**

Biwair is an ode to Every Extend, a cult game that appeared on 2004, that can be put in the shooter genre, but considering that the only way to attack is self-destruction, in order to create chain reactions of exploding enemies, what means that the player needs to intelligently do it. Luckily, lives can be gained through scoring points, but with constantly increasing values...

Explosion chains give more points the longer they are, what makes very important to plan the actions. To maximize the score it's importat to pick up power-ups that increase the game speed, which in turn makes harder to survive...

**This engine is implemented in plain ActionScript**, so it can be either played on any browser through Flash Player or compiled to any platform (Windows, Linux, Android, iOS) through Adobe AIR.

Please note that to build the game you should:
  1. Fork/download this repo.
  2. Provide the necessary (even stub) assets. If you use the FlashDevelop IDE it will point to the missing paths.
